    REVISIONS   :
    * 11:01 AM 6/15/2021 Ren'd Build-AADSignErrorsHash -> Initialize-AADSignErrorsHash (compliant verb) ; copied over vers from profile-AAD-Signons.ps1 ; kept updated CBH. 
    * 8:50 PM 1/12/2020 expanded aliases
    * 9:53 AM 8/29/2019 amended 50135, 50125, with MS support comments, and reserached 50140 a bit
    * 2:49 PM 8/27/2019 updated errornumber 0 to be (undocumented - successful), as it is the code on a non-error logon
    * 10:41 AM 5/13/2019 init vers
